# Where's the cat?

## About

It's like finding Waldo, except for with cats. <br/>
Find the cat in the image as quickly as you can! If you are in the top 10 for speed, you get to put your name on the leaderboard. There's three levels with the difficult increasing with each one.

## Tools

This web application was made with React and Vite. It also utilizes Firebase to store the leaderboard and the coordinates of the cat.
SASS was used to simplify the CSS and plugin Prettier helped me clean up the code throughout. <br/>
Zustand was used to easily manage and modify the state throughout the app.
